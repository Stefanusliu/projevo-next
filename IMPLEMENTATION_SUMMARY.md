# Implementation Summary: Midtrans Payment Integration

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core Payment Flow
- **Trigger**: When a project owner accepts a vendor proposal for the first time
- **Amount**: 50% of the total proposal amount (automatically calculated)
- **Payment Gateway**: Midtrans Snap integration with support for various payment methods
- **Process**: Payment completion ‚Üí Automatic vendor selection ‚Üí Email notifications

### 2. API Endpoints Created
- **`/api/midtrans/create-payment`**: Creates Midtrans payment token
- **`/api/midtrans/webhook`**: Handles payment status notifications from Midtrans

### 3. React Components
- **`MidtransPaymentModal`**: User-friendly payment interface
- **Updated `ProjectOwnerDetailPage`**: Integrated payment flow into vendor selection

### 4. Database Integration
- Payment records stored in Firestore `payments` collection
- Project status automatically updated upon successful payment
- Proposal status changed to 'selected' with payment reference

### 5. Email Notifications
- **Vendor Notification**: Sent when selected and payment is completed
- **Project Owner Confirmation**: Payment success and vendor selection confirmation
- **Professional Templates**: HTML email templates with project details

### 6. Security Features
- Server-side API key management
- Webhook signature verification ready (commented for development)
- Environment variable protection
- Payment amount validation

```

## üéØ How It Works

### User Experience Flow
1. **Project Owner** reviews vendor proposals in the project dashboard
2. Clicks **"Accept"** on a preferred proposal
3. **Payment modal appears** asking for 50% down payment
4. Completes payment through **Midtrans Snap** (supports cards, bank transfer, e-wallets)
5. Upon successful payment, vendor is **automatically selected**
6. **Both parties receive email notifications**

### Technical Process Flow
1. `handleAcceptProposal()` detects first vendor selection
2. Payment modal opens with calculated 50% amount
3. Frontend calls `/api/midtrans/create-payment` to get payment token
4. Midtrans Snap processes the payment
5. Midtrans sends webhook to `/api/midtrans/webhook`
6. Webhook validates payment and completes vendor selection
7. Email notifications sent to both parties
8. Project status updated in database

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (Already Added)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIDTRANS_CLIENT_KEY=SB-Mid-client-YOUR_KEY
MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY=SB-Mid-server-YOUR_KEY  
MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### What You Need to Do
1. **Get Midtrans Account**: Sign up at [https://midtrans.com](https://midtrans.com)
2. **Get Credentials**: From Midtrans dashboard (sandbox for testing)
3. **Update Environment Variables**: Replace placeholder keys with real ones
4. **Configure Webhook**: Set webhook URL in Midtrans dashboard
5. **Test**: Use the test page at `/test/midtrans`

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Page
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/test/midtrans`
- Click "Test Payment Modal"
- Use test card: `4811 1111 1111 1114`
- Complete payment flow

### 2. Full Integration Test
1. Create a project as project owner
2. Submit a proposal as vendor  
3. Accept proposal as project owner
4. Complete payment when modal appears
5. Verify vendor receives email notification
6. Check project status in dashboard

### 3. Test Payment Scenarios
- **Success**: Use `4811 1111 1111 1114`
- **Failure**: Use `4011 1111 1111 1112`
- **Pending**: Use specific test cards from Midtrans docs

## üí° Key Features Highlights

### 1. Smart Payment Detection
- Only triggers payment for **first vendor selection**
- Subsequent vendor changes don't require payment
- Checks project status to avoid duplicate payments

### 2. Automatic Process Completion
- No manual intervention needed after payment
- Webhook handles all post-payment logic
- Database updates happen automatically

### 3. Comprehensive Notifications
- Professional email templates
- Project and payment details included
- Both parties stay informed

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Payment failures are handled gracefully
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging

### 5. Security Considerations
- Server keys never exposed to frontend
- Webhook validation ready for production
- Payment amounts validated server-side

## üöÄ Ready for Production

### Current Status: ‚úÖ Development Ready
- All core functionality implemented
- Test environment configured

### For Production Deployment:
1. Set up production Midtrans account
2. Configure production webhook URL
3. Set `MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION=true`
4. Enable webhook signature verification
5. Set up monitoring and logging
